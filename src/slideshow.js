/**
 * Used to cycle through projects or images of a project within the popup without having to
 * leave popup mode and triggering the zooming-out animation.
 * Clicking one of the arrows to the left/right of the popup moves to the previous/next
 * project in the matrix, respectively. Clicking a secondary image in a project causes it to
 * swap places with the primary image, meaning that the secondary image occupies the largest
 * space and allowing the user to get a closer look at the secondary image.

/*
// Variables
var projIdx // Index of the project in the matrix
var imgIdx // Index of the image in a project's array of images

// Get current indices

// If arrow is clicked on, increment/decrement index and update info displayed in popup

// If secondary image is clicked on, use temp value to swap the secondary image and the
// primary image currently displayed. The secondary slide images and the primary image
// will reset back to their original images upon moving to a new project in the popup or
// leaving the popup.
