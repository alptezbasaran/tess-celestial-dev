Soccer Ball,Soccer-Ball.png,Soccer Ball,SoccerBall1.gif,SoccerBall2A.gif,SoccerBall2B.gif,SoccerBall2C.gif,"A soccer ball is not a perfect sphere -- it's just an approximation built from pentagons and hexagons. Mathematicians describe this using the symbol (5,5,6): two pentagons (5 sides) and a hexagon (6 sides) come together at each corner. There are many other ways of approximating the sphere with polygons. This is a polyhedron (3,3,3,3,5), consisting of 4 triangles and a pentagon at each vertex, that can also be thought as a tessellation of a sphere. We see its various deconstructions: a wireframe, just the pentagons, just the triangles, in general, and with the pentagons filled in further with triangles according to symmetries of the whole object. Which and how many individual polygonal tiles are needed to trick us into perceiving it as a ball? "
Octagon Pulse,OctagonPulseFinal.gif,Octagon Pulse,,,,,"Since the Earth is not flat the roads that we travel on are not straight lines- they lie on the sphere. In everyday life we experience only a very small part of our universe, which appears flat. But if we could see a bigger piece or scale things up, like this octagon in the animation, we would see that our universe has curvature. This animation shows what it would look like to live in so called hyperbolic space, where space curves ""negatively"" -- just the opposite of the ""positively curved"" sphere. Einstein's theory of general relativity says that the gravity we experience is precisely the result of space itself being curved."
