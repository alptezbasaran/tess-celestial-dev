Escheresque,myEscher.png,,myEscher1.png,myEscher2.png,myEscher3.png,,"Let us take a tour of mathematics behind Escher’s works. Woodcut Circle Limit III 1959 is based on the tessellation (3,4,3,4,3,4) (top). We can use color as a clue and the theory of symmetry to determine the basic tile (middle). In fact Escher’s tessellation is generated algebraically just from this basic tile. Finally we choose a pattern for our tile containing pieces of 3 differently colored fish and hand it back to mathematics to obtain Escher’s tessellation."
Soccer ball reinvented,soccerBall.png,,soccerBall1.png,soccerBall2.png,soccerBall3.png,soccerBall4.png,"A soccer ball is not a perfect sphere -- it's just an approximation built from pentagons and hexagons. More precisely, 2 pentagons and a hexagon at each corner or (5,5,6). There are many other ways of approximating the sphere with polygons. The polyhedron (3,3,3,3,5), consisting of four triangles and a pentagon at each vertex is also a tessellation of a sphere. Check out its deconstructions: a wireframe, just the pentagons, just the triangles, etc. Do you perceive any as a ball? A new kind of soccer ball?"
The Shape of the Universe,shapeUni.png,,,,,,"Since the Earth is not flat, the roads that we travel on are not straight lines -- they lie on the sphere. In everyday life we experience only a very small part of our universe, which appears flat. But if we could see a bigger piece or scale things up, like this octagon in the animation, we would see that our universe has curvature. This animation shows what it would look like to live in so called hyperbolic space, where space curves ""negatively"" -- just the opposite of the ""positively curved"" sphere. PS Einstein's theory of general relativity says that the gravity we experience is precisely the result of space itself being curved. So this is not just an idle curiosity"""
Caught in a dual net,caughtInaDualNet.png,,caughtInaDualNet1.png,caughtInaDualNet2.png,caughtInaDualNet3.png,,"The tessellation consisting of 7 triangles at each vertex (3^7) was known to the German mathematician Felix Klein in 1876. Caught in a Dual Net (2008) was obtained by superimposing this tessellation (in red) with the one consisting of 3 heptagons at each vertex (7^3) (in purple). This reveals the tessellation (6,6,7) with turquoise heptagon and two hexagons bounded by wire models of the previous two tessellations, their edges alternating between red and purple"
Tessellation or not?,seaPearls.png,,seaPearls1.png,,,,"Clever choice of a tile can hide the structure of the tessellation! The core pattern of Sea Pearls (2011) tessellation consists of red and white circles of various sizes, and color intensities. It is extended to the whole hyperbolic plane under symmetries of the original tessellation (7,7,7,7), but the asymmetry of the pattern has the overall effect of breaking the original symmetry of the tessellation consisting of four heptagons at each vertex. The Pearls 37 tessellation is a perfect example how broken symmetry of one tessellation can work perfectly with the symmetries of the other!"
Algorithmic Math Art,algMathArt.png,,algMathArt1.png,algMathArt2.png,,algMathArt4.png,"The geometry and combinatorics behind the tessellations provide the framework for creative, artistic expression. The other way around, choice of basic motif can alter and hide the mathematical structure, depending on its internal symmetries and the way it is positioned inside the fundamental region. In this image the pattern exceeds the size of the tile and the overlaps create a flowy effect, hence the name Eridanus."
Ethnomathematics,ethnomath.png,,ethnomath1.png,ethnomath2.png,ethnomath3.jpg,,"Tessellation of the hyperbolic plane called Seven towers (2011) is inspired by Japanese pagodas but realized in classical black, red and white color scheme, emphasizing local 7-fold symmetry. Similarly, we used the photo of torii from Fushimi Inari in Kyoto, Japan as a pattern in a tessellation with 7 triangles."
Numbers vs. Tessellations,nonUnique.png,,nonUnique1.png,nonUnique2.png,,,"Software Tess takes in a sequence of numbers, vertex symbol, and tries to construct a tessellation. The relation between the vertex symbols and tessellations is an intricate one! Sometimes the tessellation corresponding to a symbol is unique and sometimes not, like in our example (3,4,6,4) which corresponds to two different tilings. Although there are infinitely many tessellations of the hyperbolic plane, not all vertex configurations form a tessellation e.g. (3,5,4,5)."
Hyperbolic Klee aka the Twittering Machine,hyperKlee.png,,hyperKlee1.png,hyperKlee2.png,,,"Beautiful ideas and objects in mathematics sometimes also have aesthetically appealing visualization. This is a disguised uniform tessellation (4,4,4,6) of the hyperbolic plane whose structure was enriched with different tiles of various degrees of symmetry."
A day in a life of a mathematician,mathDay.png,,mathDay1.jpg,,,,"To answer your question:  mathematicians still use whiteboards (although blackboards and chalk are preffered) to do research!A hyperbolic tessellation consisting of six hexagons at each vertex, using the white board in my office to fill in the tiles. This is a kaleidoscopic tessellation: the edges of the tiles act as mirrors to reflect the white board image."
Same or different?,sameDiff.png,,sameDiff1.png,sameDiff2.png,sameDiff3.png,,"These tessellations are the same. The only difference is which polygon was placed in the center of the disk: triangle, square, or a hexagon! Even stranger things happen when the tessellation is placed randomly inside the disk. Perspective matters!"
Networks and squares,networksSquares.png,,networksSquares1.png,networksSquares2.png,networksSquares3.png,networksSquares4.png,"Let’s say you have 4 friends, each with 4 friends, so that some of the friendships overlap (one of your friend’s friends is also friends with a different friend of yours). This confusing situation can be encoded in a grid. If each friend had 5 friends, instead of 4, the grid would not do, as we need 5 connections.  We would need even more room for a social network that branched 6 ways. This is just a glimpse of relations between networks and tessellations and why the hyperbolic plane is perfect for drawing networks (social, computer, or otherwise)."
Color symmetry,colSymm.png,,colSymm1.png,colSymm2.png,colSymm3.png,colSymm4.png,"We can use color to keep track of the symmetries of the tessellation. Different color schemes have a different visual impact. Can you tell which ones record the same information?"
