Escheresque,myEscher.png,,myEscher1.png,myEscher2.png,myEscher3.png,,"M.C. Escher was an artist that utilized mathematical principles. His Woodcut Circle Limit III (1959) is based on a tessellation using the (3,4,3,4,3,4) equation. Applying color and the theory of symmetry, we can determine the basic tile that Escher generated algebraically. Choosing a section of the basic tile, and assigning different colors to the three fish"" we can adapt Escher's tessellation into a beautiful tiled pattern.""",,,,,,
Soccer ball reinvented,soccerBall.png,,soccerBall1.png,soccerBall2.png,soccerBall3.png,soccerBall4.png,"A soccer ball is not a perfect sphere -- it is in fact an approximation built from pentagons and hexagons. More precisely, there are two pentagons and a hexagon at each corner, or (5,5,6). There are many other ways of approximating the sphere with polygons. For example, the polyhedron (3,3,3,3,5), consisting of four triangles and a pentagon at each vertex is also a tessellation of a sphere. Viewing these deconstructions (a wireframe, just pentagons, and just triangles), the tessellation becomes a soccer ball reinvented.",,,,,,
The Shape of the Universe,shapeUni.gif,,,,,,"What would it look like to live in so called hyperbolic space, where space curves negatively"" -- just the opposite of the ""positively curved"" sphere? Since the Earth is not flat", the roads we travel on are not straight lines -- they lie on the surface of our planet. We experience a very small part of our universe that appears flat, but if we could see it from a mathematical perspective, like the octagon in this animation, we would agree that our universe has curvature. In fact, Einstein's theory of general relativity confirms that the result of space being curved is what we know of as gravity," not just an idle curiosity."""
Caught in a dual net,caughtInaDualNet.png,,caughtInaDualNet1.png,caughtInaDualNet2.png,caughtInaDualNet3.png,,"Felix Klein observed a tessellation in 1876 consisting of seven triangles at each vertex (3^7). This representation, titled Caught in a Dual Net (2008), superimposes Klein's observation in red over three heptagons at each vertex in purple, revealing a new tessellation (6,6,7). The turquoise heptagon and two hexagons are bounded by wire models of (3^7) and (7^3), with edges alternating between red and purple.",,,,,,
Tessellation or not?,seaPearls.png,,seaPearls1.png,seaPearls2.png,,,"Sometimes the structure of a tessellation can be hidden. The core pattern of Sea Pearls (2011) consists of red and white circles of various sizes and color intensities that extend to the whole hyperbolic plane under symmetries of the original tessellation (7,7,7,7). The asymmetry of the pattern has the overall effect of breaking the original symmetry of the tessellation consisting of four heptagons at each vertex. The Sea of Pearls is a perfect example of how broken symmetry of one tessellation can complement the symmetries of the other.",,,,,,
Algorithmic Math Art,algMathArt.png,,algMathArt1.png,algMathArt2.png,,,"The geometry and combinatorics behind the tessellations provide the framework for creative, artistic expression. Sometimes, the choice of a particular motif can alter or hide the mathematical structure, obscuring internal symmetries and how objects are positioned inside the graphic. This image, titled Eridanus after the Greek river god, has a pattern that exceeds the size of the tile, creating an overlapping, flowing effect reminiscent of a stream.",,,,,,
Sugaku-geijyutsu,sugaku.png,,sugaku1.jpg,sugaku2.png,sugaku3.png,sugaku4.jpg,"Sangaku are geometrical theorems or problems painted on wooden tablets. Placed as offerings at Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples during the Edo period by members of all social classes, the Sangaku was often presented as mathematical solutions to questions or challenges to congregants.  Seven towers (2011) features a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane and is inspired by Japanese pagodas. Shown in a classical black, red and white color scheme, the tessellation emphasizes a local 7-fold symmetry. The next tessellation uses a photo taken of the torii gates at Fushimi Inari, the head shrine of the god Inari in Kyoto, Japan using a pattern of 7 triangles and one of sangaku with 6 squares at a vertex.",,,,,,
Numbers vs. Tessellations,nonUniqueB.png,,nonUniqueB1.png,nonUniqueB2.png,,,"Software Tess takes in a sequence of numbers, vertex symbol, and tries to construct a tessellation. The relation between the vertex symbols and tessellations is an intricate one! Sometimes the tessellation corresponding to a symbol is unique and sometimes not, like in our example (3,4,6,4) which corresponds to two different tilings. Although there are infinitely many tessellations of the hyperbolic plane, not all vertex configurations form a tessellation e.g. (3,5,4,5).",,,,,,

This tessellation (4,4,4,6), a disguised uniform object on the hyperbolic plane, is enriched with different tiles of various degrees of symmetry. The appeal of this kind of tessellation can be in the appreciation of the visual itself, a comprehension of the mathematics behind it, or the interplay of the two.",,,,,,

To answer your question, mathematicians still use whiteboards, although blackboards and chalk are preferred to do research.

The edges of the tiles in the tessellation act as mirrors to reflect the white board image.",,,,,,
Same or different?,sameDiff.png,,sameDiff1.png,sameDiff2.png,sameDiff3.png,,"Perspective matters nearly as much as position.

Networks and squares,networksSquares.png,,networksSquares1.png,networksSquares2.png,networksSquares3.png,networksSquares4.png,"These networks and squares explore social network connections. Let's start with four friends at each corner of the square.  Each of these four friends have four other friends making their friendships overlap.  One of your friend's friends is also friends with a different friend creating a confusing social network to be encoded in a grid. If each friend has five friends, instead of four, the grid shape would not work, as we would need five connections. We would need even more room for a social network that branched six ways. Due to the number of connections, tessellations and the hyperbolic plane is perfect for drawing these social network connections.",,,,,,

Coincidentally, there are exactly five regular tessellations of the sphere, usually drawn as regular polyhedra.
